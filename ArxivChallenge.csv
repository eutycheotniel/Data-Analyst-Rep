Cyber Security Behaviour In Organisations,2020-04-24T14:17:46Z,"This review explores the academic and policy literature in the context of
everyday cyber security in organisations. In so doing, it identifies four
behavioural sets that influences how people practice cyber security. These are
compliance with security policy, intergroup coordination and communication,
phishing/email behaviour, and password behaviour. However, it is important to
note that these are not exhaustive and they do not exist in isolation. In
addition, the review explores the notion of security culture as an overarching
theme that overlaps and frames the four behavioural sets. The aim of this
review is therefore to provide a summary of the existing literature in the area
of everyday cyber security within the social sciences, with a particular focus
on organisational contexts. In doing so, it develops a series of suggestions
for future research directions based on existing gaps in the literature. The
review also includes a theoretical lens that will aid the understanding of
existing studies and wider literatures. Where possible, the review makes
recommendations for organisations in relation to everyday cyber security."
Uncertainty in Cyber Security Investments,2017-12-16T02:05:44Z,"When undertaking cyber security risk assessments, we must assign numeric
values to metrics to compute the final expected loss that represents the risk
that an organization is exposed to due to cyber threats. Even if risk
assessment is motivated from real-world observations and data, there is always
a high chance of assigning inaccurate values due to different uncertainties
involved (e.g., evolving threat landscape, human errors) and the natural
difficulty of quantifying risk per se. Our previous work has proposed a model
and a software tool that empowers organizations to compute optimal cyber
security strategies given their financial constraints, i.e., available cyber
security budget. We have also introduced a general game-theoretic model with
uncertain payoffs (probability-distribution-valued payoffs) showing that such
uncertainty can be incorporated in the game-theoretic model by allowing payoffs
to be random. In this paper, we combine our aforesaid works and we conclude
that although uncertainties in cyber security risk assessment lead, on average,
to different cyber security strategies, they do not play significant role into
the final expected loss of the organization when using our model and
methodology to derive this strategies. We show that our tool is capable of
providing effective decision support. To the best of our knowledge this is the
first paper that investigates how uncertainties on various parameters affect
cyber security investments."
Cyber security and the Leviathan,2022-03-10T09:35:36Z,"Dedicated cyber-security functions are common in commercial businesses, who
are confronted by evolving and pervasive threats of data breaches and other
perilous security events. Such businesses are enmeshed with the wider societies
in which they operate. Using data gathered from in-depth, semi-structured
interviews with 15 Chief Information Security Officers, as well as six senior
organisational leaders, we show that the work of political philosopher Thomas
Hobbes, particularly Leviathan, offers a useful lens through which to
understand the context of these functions and of cyber security in Western
society. Our findings indicate that cyber security within these businesses
demonstrates a number of Hobbesian features that are further implicated in, and
provide significant benefits to, the wider Leviathan-esque state. These include
the normalisation of intrusive controls, such as surveillance, and the
stimulation of consumption. We conclude by suggesting implications for
cyber-security practitioners, in particular, the reflexivity that these
perspectives offer, as well as for businesses and other researchers."
Mathematical and Statistical Opportunities in Cyber Security,2009-04-09T22:30:03Z,"The role of mathematics in a complex system such as the Internet has yet to
be deeply explored. In this paper, we summarize some of the important and
pressing problems in cyber security from the viewpoint of open science
environments. We start by posing the question ""What fundamental problems exist
within cyber security research that can be helped by advanced mathematics and
statistics?"" Our first and most important assumption is that access to
real-world data is necessary to understand large and complex systems like the
Internet. Our second assumption is that many proposed cyber security solutions
could critically damage both the openness and the productivity of scientific
research. After examining a range of cyber security problems, we come to the
conclusion that the field of cyber security poses a rich set of new and
exciting research opportunities for the mathematical and statistical sciences."
Cyber Security of Smart Grid Infrastructure,2014-01-16T08:53:28Z,"Smart grid security is crucial to maintain stable and reliable power system
operation during the contingency situation due to the failure of any critical
power system component. Ensuring a secured smart grid involves with a less
possibility of power grid collapse or equipment malfunction. Due to lack of the
proper security measures, a major blackout may occur which can even lead to a
cascading failure. Therefore, to protect this critical power system
infrastructure and to ensure a reliable and an uninterrupted power supply to
the end users, smart grid security issues must be addressed with high priority.
In a smart grid environment, electric power infrastructure is modernized by
incorporating the current and future requirements and advanced functionalities
to its consumers. To make the smart grid happen, cyber system is integrated
with the physical power system. Although adoption of cyber system has made the
grid more energy efficient and modernized, it has introduced cyber-attack
issues which are critical for national infrastructure security and customer
satisfaction. Due to the cyber-attack, power grid may face operational failures
and loss of synchronization. This operational failure may damage critical power
system components which may interrupt the power supply and make the system
unstable resulting high financial penalties. In this chapter, some recent cyber
attack related incidents into a smart grid environment are discussed. The
requirements and the state of the art of cyber security issues of a critical
power system infrastructure are illustrated elaborately."
Prediction in Cyber Security: Complications and Consolations,2018-04-23T19:04:02Z,"Uncertainty, error, and similar complications add to the many challenges of
cyber security. Various disciplines have developed methods for managing these
complications, but applying these methods involves disambiguating overlapping
terminology and determining a method's proper usage in the context of cyber
security, which has unique properties. This process is here guided by the need
for prediction, which is required for cyber security to become more like
traditional sciences. A motivating malware analysis example is defined. A
five-element ontology of complications for prediction is presented, and
concepts from numerous disciplines are mapped to it in terms of the motivating
example."
Automated Big Traffic Analytics for Cyber Security,2018-04-24T13:36:54Z,"Network traffic analytics technology is a cornerstone for cyber security
systems. We demonstrate its use through three popular and contemporary cyber
security applications in intrusion detection, malware analysis and botnet
detection. However, automated traffic analytics faces the challenges raised by
big traffic data. In terms of big data's three characteristics --- volume,
variety and velocity, we review three state of the art techniques to mitigate
the key challenges including real-time traffic classification, unknown traffic
classification, and efficiency of classifiers. The new techniques using
statistical features, unknown discovery and correlation analytics show
promising potentials to deal with big traffic data. Readers are encouraged to
devote to improving the performance and practicability of automatic traffic
analytic in cyber security."
Advanced Analytics for Connected Cars Cyber Security,2017-11-06T15:13:35Z,"The vehicular connectivity revolution is fueling the automotive industry's
most significant transformation seen in decades. However, as modern vehicles
become more connected, they also become much more vulnerable to cyber-attacks.
In this paper, a fully working machine learning approach is proposed to protect
connected vehicles (fleets and individuals) against such attacks. We present a
system that monitors different vehicle's interfaces (Network, CAN and OS),
extracts relevant information based on configurable rules and sends it to a
trained generative model to detect deviations from normal behavior. Using
configurable data collector, we provide a higher level of data abstraction as
the model is trained based on events instead of raw data, which has a
noise-filtering effect and eliminates the need to retrain the model whenever a
protocol changes. We present a new approach for detecting anomalies, tailored
to the temporal nature of our domain. Adapting the hybrid approach of Gutflaish
et al. (2017) to the fully temporal setting, we first train a Hidden Markov
Model to learn normal vehicle behavior, and then a regression model to
calibrate the likelihood threshold for anomaly. Using this architecture, our
method detects sophisticated and realistic anomalies, which are missed by other
existing methods monitoring the CAN bus only. We also demonstrate the
superiority of adaptive thresholds over static ones. Furthermore, our approach
scales efficiently from monitoring individual cars to serving large fleets. We
demonstrate the competitive advantage of our model via encouraging empirical
results."
Detecting periodic subsequences in cyber security data,2017-06-05T03:26:31Z,"Statistical approaches to cyber-security involve building realistic
probability models of computer network data. In a data pre-processing phase,
separating automated events from those caused by human activity should improve
statistical model building and enhance anomaly detection capabilities. This
article presents a changepoint detection framework for identifying periodic
subsequences of event times. The opening event of each subsequence can be
interpreted as a human action which then generates an automated, periodic
process. Difficulties arising from the presence of duplicate and missing data
are addressed. The methodology is demonstrated using authentication data from
the computer network of Los Alamos National Laboratory."
Airport Cyber Security and Cyber Resilience Controls,2019-08-26T20:00:00Z,"Cyber Security scares are the main areas of demerits associated with the
advent and widespread of internet technology. While the internet has improved
life and business processes, the levels of security threats have been
increasing proportionally. As such, the web and the related cyber systems have
exposed the world to the state of continuous vigilance because of the
existential threats of attacks. Criminals are in the constant state of
attempting cybersecurity defense of various infrastructures and businesses.
Airports are some of the areas where cybersecurity means a lot of things. The
reason for the criticality of cybersecurity in airports concerns the high
integration of internet and computer systems in the operations of airports.
This paper is about airport cybersecurity and resilience controls. At the start
of the article is a comprehensive introduction that provides a preview of the
entire content. In the paper, there are discussions of airport intelligence
classification, cybersecurity malicious threats analysis, and research
methodology. A concise conclusion marks the end of the article."
Serious Games for Cyber Security Education,2016-10-29T13:56:16Z,"Phishing is an online identity theft that aims to steal sensitive information
such as username, passwords and online banking details from its victims.
Phishing education needs to be considered as a means to combat this threat.
This book focuses on a design and development of a mobile game prototype as an
educational tool helping computer users to protect themselves against phishing
attacks. The elements of a game design framework for avoiding phishing attacks
were used to address the game design issues. The mobile game design aimed to
enhance the user's avoidance behaviour through motivation to protect themselves
against phishing threats. A think-aloud study was conducted, along with a pre-
and post-test, to assess the game design framework through the developed mobile
game prototype. The study results showed a significant improvement of
participants' phishing avoidance behaviour in their post-test assessment.
Furthermore, the study findings suggest that participants' threat perception,
safeguard effectiveness, self-efficacy, perceived severity and perceived
susceptibility elements positively impact threat avoidance behaviour, whereas
safeguard cost had a negative impact on it."
Gamification Techniques for Raising Cyber Security Awareness,2019-03-20T11:45:26Z,"Due to the prevalence of online services in modern society, such as internet
banking and social media, it is important for users to have an understanding of
basic security measures in order to keep themselves safe online. However, users
often do not know how to make their online interactions secure, which
demonstrates an educational need in this area. Gamification has grown in
popularity in recent years and has been used to teach people about a range of
subjects. This paper presents an exploratory study investigating the use of
gamification techniques to educate average users about password security, with
the aim of raising overall security awareness. To explore the impact of such
techniques, a role-playing quiz application (RPG) was developed for the Android
platform to educate users about password security. Results gained from the work
highlighted that users enjoyed learning via the use of the password
application, and felt they benefitted from the inclusion of gamification
techniques. Future work seeks to expand the prototype into a full solution,
covering a range of security awareness issues."
Deep Reinforcement Learning for Cyber Security,2019-06-13T16:34:12Z,"The scale of Internet-connected systems has increased considerably, and these
systems are being exposed to cyber attacks more than ever. The complexity and
dynamics of cyber attacks require protecting mechanisms to be responsive,
adaptive, and scalable. Machine learning, or more specifically deep
reinforcement learning (DRL), methods have been proposed widely to address
these issues. By incorporating deep learning into traditional RL, DRL is highly
capable of solving complex, dynamic, and especially high-dimensional cyber
defense problems. This paper presents a survey of DRL approaches developed for
cyber security. We touch on different vital aspects, including DRL-based
security methods for cyber-physical systems, autonomous intrusion detection
techniques, and multiagent DRL-based game theory simulations for defense
strategies against cyber attacks. Extensive discussions and future research
directions on DRL-based cyber security are also given. We expect that this
comprehensive review provides the foundations for and facilitates future
studies on exploring the potential of emerging DRL to cope with increasingly
complex cyber security problems."
Cyber Security in Cloud: Risk Assessment Models,2021-06-19T14:37:31Z,"The present paper shows a proposal of the characteristics Cloud Risk
Assessment Models should have and presents the review of the literature
considering those characteristics in order to identify current gaps. This work
shows a ranking of Cloud RA models and their degree of compliance with the
theoretical reference Cloud Risk Assessment model. The review of literature
shows that RA approaches leveraging CSA (Cloud Security Alliance) STAR Registry
that have into account organizations security requirements present higher
degree of compliance, but they still lack risk economic quantification. The
myriad of conceptual models, methodologies and frameworks although based on
current NIST SP 800:30, ISO 27001, ISO 27005, ISO 30001, ENISA standards could
be enhanced by the use of techno-economic models like UTEM, created by the
author, in order to conceive more simplified models for effective Risk
Assessment and Mitigation closer to the theoretical reference model for Cloud
Risk Assessment, available for all cloud models (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS) and easy to
use for all stakeholders."
Developing and Building Ontologies in Cyber Security,2023-06-01T06:19:01Z,"Cyber Security is one of the most arising disciplines in our modern society.
We work on Cybersecurity domain and in this the topic we chose is Cyber
Security Ontologies. In this we gather all latest and previous ontologies and
compare them on the basis of different analyzing factors to get best of them.
Reason to select this topic is to assemble different ontologies from different
era of time. Because, researches that included in this SLR is mostly studied
single ontology. If any researcher wants to study ontologies, he has to study
every single ontology and select which one is best for his research. So, we
assemble different types of ontology and compare them against each other to get
best of them. A total 24 papers between years 2010-2020 are carefully selected
through systematic process and classified accordingly. Lastly, this SLR have
been presented to provide the researchers promising future directions in the
domain of cybersecurity ontologies."
Towards a Networks-of-Networks Framework for Cyber Security,2013-04-24T21:35:19Z,"Networks-of-networks (NoN) is a graph-theoretic model of interdependent
networks that have distinct dynamics at each network (layer). By adding special
edges to represent relationships between nodes in different layers, NoN
provides a unified mechanism to study interdependent systems intertwined in a
complex relationship. While NoN based models have been proposed for
cyber-physical systems, in this position paper we build towards a three-layered
NoN model for an enterprise cyber system. Each layer captures a different facet
of a cyber system. We present in-depth discussion for four major graph-
theoretic applications to demonstrate how the three-layered NoN model can be
leveraged for continuous system monitoring and mission assurance."
Automatic Labeling for Entity Extraction in Cyber Security,2013-08-22T18:23:25Z,"Timely analysis of cyber-security information necessitates automated
information extraction from unstructured text. While state-of-the-art
extraction methods produce extremely accurate results, they require ample
training data, which is generally unavailable for specialized applications,
such as detecting security related entities; moreover, manual annotation of
corpora is very costly and often not a viable solution. In response, we develop
a very precise method to automatically label text from several data sources by
leveraging related, domain-specific, structured data and provide public access
to a corpus annotated with cyber-security entities. Next, we implement a
Maximum Entropy Model trained with the average perceptron on a portion of our
corpus ($\sim$750,000 words) and achieve near perfect precision, recall, and
accuracy, with training times under 17 seconds."
A Supervisory Control Approach to Dynamic Cyber-Security,2014-09-02T19:42:10Z,"An analytical approach for a dynamic cyber-security problem that captures
progressive attacks to a computer network is presented. We formulate the
dynamic security problem from the defender's point of view as a supervisory
control problem with imperfect information, modeling the computer network's
operation by a discrete event system. We consider a min-max performance
criterion and use dynamic programming to determine, within a restricted set of
policies, an optimal policy for the defender. We study and interpret the
behavior of this optimal policy as we vary certain parameters of the
supervisory control problem."
A Predictive Framework for Cyber Security Analytics using Attack Graphs,2015-02-04T15:47:56Z,"Security metrics serve as a powerful tool for organizations to understand the
effectiveness of protecting computer networks. However majority of these
measurement techniques don't adequately help corporations to make informed risk
management decisions. In this paper we present a stochastic security framework
for obtaining quantitative measures of security by taking into account the
dynamic attributes associated with vulnerabilities that can change over time.
Our model is novel as existing research in attack graph analysis do not
consider the temporal aspects associated with the vulnerabilities, such as the
availability of exploits and patches which can affect the overall network
security based on how the vulnerabilities are interconnected and leveraged to
compromise the system. In order to have a more realistic representation of how
the security state of the network would vary over time, a nonhomogeneous model
is developed which incorporates a time dependent covariate, namely the
vulnerability age. The daily transition-probability matrices are estimated
using Frei's Vulnerability Lifecycle model. We also leverage the trusted CVSS
metric domain to analyze how the total exploitability and impact measures
evolve over a time period for a given network."
Comparing Decision Support Approaches for Cyber Security Investment,2015-02-19T11:30:03Z,"When investing in cyber security resources, information security managers
have to follow effective decision-making strategies. We refer to this as the
cyber security investment challenge. In this paper, we consider three possible
decision-support methodologies for security managers to tackle this challenge.
We consider methods based on game theory, combinatorial optimisation and a
hybrid of the two. Our modelling starts by building a framework where we can
investigate the effectiveness of a cyber security control regarding the
protection of different assets seen as targets in presence of commodity
threats. In terms of game theory we consider a 2-person control game between
the security manager who has to choose among different implementation levels of
a cyber security control, and a commodity attacker who chooses among different
targets to attack. The pure game theoretical methodology consists of a large
game including all controls and all threats. In the hybrid methodology the game
solutions of individual control-games along with their direct costs (e.g.
financial) are combined with a knapsack algorithm to derive an optimal
investment strategy. The combinatorial optimisation technique consists of a
multi-objective multiple choice knapsack based strategy. We compare these
approaches on a case study that was built on SANS top critical controls. The
main achievements of this work is to highlight the weaknesses and strengths of
different investment methodologies for cyber security, the benefit of their
interaction, and the impact that indirect costs have on cyber security
investment."
"Recommendations on Future Operational Environments Command Control and
  Cyber Security",2015-02-23T13:37:29Z,"It is a well-known fact that today a nation's telecommunication networks,
critical infrastructure, and information systems are vulnerable to growing
number of attacks in cyberspace. Cyber space contains very different problems
involving various sets of threats, targets and costs. Cyber security is not
only problem of banking, communication or transportation. It also threatens
core systems of army as command control. Some significant recommendations on
command control (C2) and cyber security have been suggested for army computing
environment in this paper. This study addresses priorities of ""what should be
done for a better army cyber future"" to cyber security researchers."
Towards a relation extraction framework for cyber-security concepts,2015-04-16T17:26:24Z,"In order to assist security analysts in obtaining information pertaining to
their network, such as novel vulnerabilities, exploits, or patches, information
retrieval methods tailored to the security domain are needed. As labeled text
data is scarce and expensive, we follow developments in semi-supervised Natural
Language Processing and implement a bootstrapping algorithm for extracting
security entities and their relationships from text. The algorithm requires
little input data, specifically, a few relations or patterns (heuristics for
identifying relations), and incorporates an active learning component which
queries the user on the most important decisions to prevent drifting from the
desired relations. Preliminary testing on a small corpus shows promising
results, obtaining precision of .82."
Mitigating Hardware Cyber-Security Risks in Error Correcting Decoders,2015-05-06T03:47:36Z,"This paper investigates hardware cyber-security risks associated with channel
decoders, which are commonly acquired as a black box in semiconductor industry.
It is shown that channel decoders are potentially attractive targets for
hardware cyber-security attacks and can be easily embedded with malicious
blocks. Several attack scenarios are considered in this work and suitable
methods for mitigating the risks are proposed. These methods are based on
randomizing the inputs of the channel decoder to obstruct the communications
between attackers and the malicious blocks, ideally without changing the
decoding performance."
Mean-field-game model for Botnet defense in Cyber-security,2015-11-20T15:32:31Z,"We initiate the analysis of the response of computer owners to various offers
of defence systems
  against a cyber-hacker (for instance, a botnet attack), as a stochastic game
of a large number of interacting agents. We introduce a simple mean-field game
that models their behavior. It takes into account both the random process of
the propagation of the infection (controlled by the botner herder) and the
decision making process of customers. Its stationary version turns out to be
exactly solvable (but not at all trivial) under an additional natural
assumption that the execution time of the decisions of the customers (say,
switch on or out the defence system) is much faster that the infection rates."
Human Behaviour as an aspect of Cyber Security Assurance,2016-01-15T13:56:49Z,"There continue to be numerous breaches publicised pertaining to cyber
security despite security practices being applied within industry for many
years. This article is intended to be the first in a number of articles as
research into cyber security assurance processes. This article is compiled
based on current research related to cyber security assurance and the impact of
the human element on it. The objective of this work is to identify elements of
cyber security that would benefit from further research and development based
on the literature review findings. The results outlined in this article present
a need for the cyber security field to look in to established industry areas to
benefit from effective practices such as human reliability assessment, along
with improved methods of validation such as statistical quality control in
order to obtain true assurance. The article proposes the development of a
framework that will be based upon defined and repeatable quantification,
specifically relating to the range of human aspect tasks that provide, or are
intended not to negatively affect cyber security posture."
"Modelling Cyber-Security Experts' Decision Making Processes using
  Aggregation Operators",2016-08-30T15:21:42Z,"An important role carried out by cyber-security experts is the assessment of
proposed computer systems, during their design stage. This task is fraught with
difficulties and uncertainty, making the knowledge provided by human experts
essential for successful assessment. Today, the increasing number of
progressively complex systems has led to an urgent need to produce tools that
support the expert-led process of system-security assessment. In this research,
we use weighted averages (WAs) and ordered weighted averages (OWAs) with
evolutionary algorithms (EAs) to create aggregation operators that model parts
of the assessment process. We show how individual overall ratings for security
components can be produced from ratings of their characteristics, and how these
individual overall ratings can be aggregated to produce overall rankings of
potential attacks on a system. As well as the identification of salient attacks
and weak points in a prospective system, the proposed method also highlights
which factors and security components contribute most to a component's
difficulty and attack ranking respectively. A real world scenario is used in
which experts were asked to rank a set of technical attacks, and to answer a
series of questions about the security components that are the subject of the
attacks. The work shows how finding good aggregation operators, and identifying
important components and factors of a cyber-security problem can be automated.
The resulting operators have the potential for use as decision aids for systems
designers and cyber-security experts, increasing the amount of assessment that
can be achieved with the limited resources available."
Traffic-aware Patching for Cyber Security in Mobile IoT,2017-03-15T21:59:05Z,"The various types of communication technologies and mobility features in
Internet of Things (IoT) on the one hand enable fruitful and attractive
applications, but on the other hand facilitates malware propagation, thereby
raising new challenges on handling IoT-empowered malware for cyber security.
Comparing with the malware propagation control scheme in traditional wireless
networks where nodes can be directly repaired and secured, in IoT, compromised
end devices are difficult to be patched. Alternatively, blocking malware via
patching intermediate nodes turns out to be a more feasible and practical
solution. Specifically, patching intermediate nodes can effectively prevent the
proliferation of malware propagation by securing infrastructure links and
limiting malware propagation to local device-to-device dissemination. This
article proposes a novel traffic-aware patching scheme to select important
intermediate nodes to patch, which applies to the IoT system with limited
patching resources and response time constraint. Experiments on real-world
trace datasets in IoT networks are conducted to demonstrate the advantage of
the proposed traffic-aware patching scheme in alleviating malware propagation."
Cyber-Security in Smart Grid: Survey and Challenges,2018-08-31T21:56:00Z,"Smart grid uses the power of information technology to intelligently deliver
energy to customers by using a two-way communication, and wisely meet the
environmental requirements by facilitating the integration of green
technologies. Although smart grid addresses several problems of the traditional
grid, it faces a number of security challenges. Because communication has been
incorporated into the electrical power with its inherent weaknesses, it has
exposed the system to numerous risks. Several research papers have discussed
these problems. However, most of them classified attacks based on
confidentiality, integrity, and availability, and they excluded attacks which
compromise other security criteria such as accountability. In addition, the
existed security countermeasures focus on countering some specific attacks or
protecting some specific components, but there is no global approach which
combines these solutions to secure the entire system. The purpose of this paper
is to provide a comprehensive overview of the relevant published works. First,
we review the security requirements. Then, we investigate in depth a number of
important cyber-attacks in smart grid to diagnose the potential vulnerabilities
along with their impact. In addition, we proposed a cyber security strategy as
a solution to address breaches, counter attacks, and deploy appropriate
countermeasures. Finally, we provide some future research directions."
A Cyber-Security Investment Game for Networked Control Systems,2018-09-29T16:34:56Z,"We formulate a resource-planning game between an attacker and a defender of a
network control system. We consider the network to be operating in closed-loop
with a linear quadratic regulator (LQR). We construct a general-sum,
two-player, mixed strategy game, where the attacker attempts to destroy
communication equipment of some nodes, and thereby render the LQR feedback gain
matrix to be sparse, leading to degradation of closed-loop performance. The
defender, on the other hand, aims to prevent this loss. Both players trade
their control performance objectives for the cost of their actions. A Mixed
Strategy Nash Equilibrium (MSNE) of the game represents the allocation of the
players' respective resources for attacking or protecting the network nodes. We
analyze the dependence of a MSNE on the relative budgets of the players as well
as on the important network nodes that must be preserved to achieve a desirable
LQR performance. MSNE is computed using nonlinear programming. Results are
validated using the New England power system model, and it is shown that
reliable defense is feasible unless the cost of attack is very low or much
smaller than the cost of protection per generator."
Deep-Net: Deep Neural Network for Cyber Security Use Cases,2018-12-09T16:44:56Z,"Deep neural networks (DNNs) have witnessed as a powerful approach in this
year by solving long-standing Artificial intelligence (AI) supervised and
unsupervised tasks exists in natural language processing, speech processing,
computer vision and others. In this paper, we attempt to apply DNNs on three
different cyber security use cases: Android malware classification, incident
detection and fraud detection. The data set of each use case contains real
known benign and malicious activities samples. The efficient network
architecture for DNN is chosen by conducting various trails of experiments for
network parameters and network structures. The experiments of such chosen
efficient configurations of DNNs are run up to 1000 epochs with learning rate
set in the range [0.01-0.5]. Experiments of DNN performed well in comparison to
the classical machine learning algorithms in all cases of experiments of cyber
security use cases. This is due to the fact that DNNs implicitly extract and
build better features, identifies the characteristics of the data that lead to
better accuracy. The best accuracy obtained by DNN and XGBoost on Android
malware classification 0.940 and 0.741, incident detection 1.00 and 0.997 fraud
detection 0.972 and 0.916 respectively."
"Semisupervised Adversarial Neural Networks for Cyber Security Transfer
  Learning",2019-07-25T15:14:38Z,"On the path to establishing a global cybersecurity framework where each
enterprise shares information about malicious behavior, an important question
arises. How can a machine learning representation characterizing a cyber attack
on one network be used to detect similar attacks on other enterprise networks
if each networks has wildly different distributions of benign and malicious
traffic? We address this issue by comparing the results of naively transferring
a model across network domains and using CORrelation ALignment, to our novel
adversarial Siamese neural network. Our proposed model learns attack
representations that are more invariant to each network's particularities via
an adversarial approach. It uses a simple ranking loss that prioritizes the
labeling of the most egregious malicious events correctly over average
accuracy. This is appropriate for driving an alert triage workflow wherein an
analyst only has time to inspect the top few events ranked highest by the
model. In terms of accuracy, the other approaches fail completely to detect any
malicious events when models were trained on one dataset are evaluated on
another for the first 100 events. While, the method presented here retrieves
sizable proportions of malicious events, at the expense of some training
instabilities due in adversarial modeling. We evaluate these approaches using 2
publicly available networking datasets, and suggest areas for future research."

Cyber security insights into self-proclaimed virtual world hackers,2019-08-29T01:31:53Z,"Virtual worlds have become highly popular in recent years with reports of
over a billion people accessing these environments and the virtual goods market
growing to near 50 billion US dollars. An undesirable outcome to this
popularity and market value is thriving criminal activity in these worlds. The
most profitable cyber security problem in virtual worlds is named Virtual
Property Theft. The aim of this study is to use an online survey to gain
insight into how hackers (n=100) in these synthetic worlds conduct their
criminal activity. This survey is the first to report an insight into the
criminal mind of hackers (virtual thieves). Results showed a clear-cut profile
of a virtual property thief, they appear to be mainly aged 20-24 years of age,
live in the United States of America, while using virtual worlds for 5-7 hours
a day. These and the other key results of this study will provide a pathway for
designing an effective anti-theft framework capable of abolishing this cyber
security issue."
"Approaching the Automation of Cyber Security Testing of Connected
  Vehicles",2019-11-15T12:34:55Z,"The advancing digitalization of vehicles and automotive systems bears many
advantages for creating and enhancing comfort and safety-related systems
ranging from drive-by-wire, inclusion of advanced displays, entertainment
systems up to sophisticated driving assistance and autonomous driving. It,
however, also contains the inherent risk of being used for purposes that are
not intended for, raging from small non-authorized customizations to the
possibility of full-scale cyberattacks that affect several vehicles to whole
fleets and vital systems such as steering and engine control. To prevent such
conditions and mitigate cybersecurity risks from affecting the safety of road
traffic, testing cybersecurity must be adopted into automotive testing at a
large scale. Currently, the manual penetration testing processes cannot uphold
the increasing demand due to time and cost to test complex systems. We propose
an approach for an architecture that (semi-)automates automotive cybersecurity
test, allowing for more economic testing and therefore keeping up to the rising
demand induced by new vehicle functions as well as the development towards
connected and autonomous vehicles."
Insider threats in Cyber Security: The enemy within the gates,2019-11-21T16:09:21Z,"Insider threats have become reality for civilian firms such as Tesla, which
experienced sabotage and intellectual property theft, and Capital One, which
suffered from fraud. Even greater social impact was caused by the data breach
at the US Department of Defense, perpetrated by well-known attackers Chelsea
Manning and Edward Snowden, whose espionage and hacktivist activities are
widely known. The dramatic increase of such incidents in recent years and the
incalculable damage committed by insiders must serve as a warning for all
members of the cyber security community. It is no longer acceptable to continue
to underestimate the problem of insider threats. Firms, organizations,
institutions and governments need to lead and embrace a cultural change in
their security posture. Through the adoption of an Insider Threat Program that
engages all the strategic branches (including HR, Legal, Information Assurance,
Cyber Security and Intelligence), coordinated by the chief information security
officer and supported by c-level executive, it is possible to implement a
framework that can prevent, detect, and respond to disloyal and/or
unintentional insider threats. Hence, defending your enterprise from insider
threats is a vital part of information security best practices. It is essential
that your company highly valuable classified data and assets are protected from
its greatest threat: the enemy within the gates."
"A framework for effective corporate communication after cyber security
  incidents",2020-09-19T11:08:53Z,"A major cyber security incident can represent a cyber crisis for an
organisation, in particular because of the associated risk of substantial
reputational damage. As the likelihood of falling victim to a cyberattack has
increased over time, so too has the need to understand exactly what is
effective corporate communication after an attack, and how best to engage the
concerns of customers, partners and other stakeholders. This research seeks to
tackle this problem through a critical, multi-faceted investigation into the
efficacy of crisis communication and public relations following a data breach.
It does so by drawing on academic literature, obtained through a systematic
literature review, and real-world case studies. Qualitative data analysis is
used to interpret and structure the results, allowing for the development of a
new, comprehensive framework for corporate communication to support companies
in their preparation and response to such events. The validity of this
framework is demonstrated by its evaluation through interviews with senior
industry professionals, as well as a critical assessment against relevant
practice and research. The framework is further refined based on these
evaluations, and an updated version defined. This research represents the first
grounded, comprehensive and evaluated proposal for characterising effective
corporate communication after cyber security incidents."
"A Survey of Cyber Security Countermeasures Using Hardware Performance
  Counters",2018-07-28T01:43:27Z,"Cyber attacks and malware are now more prevalent than ever and the trend is
ever upward. There have been several approaches to attack detection including
resident software applications at the root or user level, e.g., virus
detection, and modifications to the OS, e.g., encryption, application signing,
etc. Some approaches have moved to lower level detection and preven- tion,
e.g., Data Execution Prevention. An emerging approach in countermeasure
development is the use of hardware performance counters existing in the
micro-architecture of modern processors. These are at the lowest level,
implemented in processor hardware, and the wealth of data collected by these
counters affords some very promising countermeasures with minimal overhead as
well as protection from being sabotaged themselves by attackers. Here, we
conduct a survey of recent techniques in realizing effective countermeasures
for cyber attack detection from these hardware performance counters."
Cyber Security Challenges and Solutions for V2X Communications: A Survey,2019-01-04T11:08:12Z,"In recent years, vehicles became able to establish connections with other
vehicles and infrastructure units that are located in the roadside. In the near
future, the vehicular network will be expanded to include the communication
between vehicles and any smart devices in the roadside which is called
Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication. The vehicular network causes many
challenges due to heterogeneous nodes, various speeds and intermittent
connection, where traditional security methods are not always efficacious. As a
result, an extensive variety of research works has been done on optimizing
security solutions whilst considering network requirements. In this paper, we
present a comprehensive survey and taxonomy of the existing security solutions
for V2X communication technology. Then, we provide discussions and comparisons
with regard to some pertinent criteria. Also, we present a threat analysis for
V2X enabling technologies. Finally, we point out the research challenges and
some future directions."
Deriving Cyber-security Requirements for Cyber Physical Systems,2019-01-07T15:05:41Z,"Today's cyber physical systems (CPS) are not well protected against cyber
attacks. Protected CPS often have holes in their defense, due to the manual
nature of today's cyber security design process. It is necessary to automate or
semi-automate the design and implementation of CPS to meet stringent cyber
security requirements (CSR), without sacrificing functional performance, timing
and cost constraints. Step one is deriving, for each CPS, the CSR that flow
from the particular functional design for that CPS. That is the task assumed by
our system, Deriving Cyber-security Requirements Yielding Protected Physical
Systems - DCRYPPS. DCRYPPS applies Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies,
including planning and model based diagnosis to an important area of cyber
security."
RNNSecureNet: Recurrent neural networks for Cyber security use-cases,2019-01-05T17:18:14Z,"Recurrent neural network (RNN) is an effective neural network in solving very
complex supervised and unsupervised tasks. There has been a significant
improvement in RNN field such as natural language processing, speech
processing, computer vision and other multiple domains. This paper deals with
RNN application on different use cases like Incident Detection, Fraud
Detection, and Android Malware Classification. The best performing neural
network architecture is chosen by conducting different chain of experiments for
different network parameters and structures. The network is run up to 1000
epochs with learning rate set in the range of 0.01 to 0.5.Obviously, RNN
performed very well when compared to classical machine learning algorithms.
This is mainly possible because RNNs implicitly extracts the underlying
features and also identifies the characteristics of the data. This helps to
achieve better accuracy."
Cyber-Security in the Emerging World of Smart Everything,2021-09-13T09:46:50Z,"The fourth industrial revolution (4IR) is a revolution many authors believe
have come to stay. It is a revolution that has been fast blurring the line
between physical, digital and biological technologies. These disruptive
technologies largely rely on high-speed internet connectivity, Cloud
technologies, Augmented Reality, Additive Manufacturing, Data science and
Artificial Intelligence. Most developed economies have embraced the it while
the developing economies are struggling to adopt 4IR because they lack the
requisite skills, knowledge and technology. Thus, this study investigates
Nigeria as one of the developing economies to understand her readiness for 4IR
and the level of preparedness to mitigate the sophisticated cyber-attacks that
comes with it. The investigation adopted quantitative research approach and
developed an online questionnaire that was shared amongst the population of
interest that includes academic, industry experts and relevant stakeholders.
The questionnaire returned 116 valid responses which were analysed with
descriptive statistical tools in SPSS. Results suggest that 60 of the
respondents opined that Nigerian government at are not showing enough evidence
to demonstrate her preparedness to leverage these promised potentials by
developing 4IR relevant laws, strong institutional frameworks and policies.
They lack significant development capacity to mitigate risks associated with
digital ecosystem and cyber ecosystem that are ushered in by the 4IR. In the
universities, 52 of the courses offered at the undergraduate and 42 at the
post-graduate levels are relevant in the development of skills required in the
revolution. The study recommends that the government at all levels make
adequate efforts in developing the countrys intangible assets. In all, this
paper posits that successful implementation of these could equip Nigeria to
embrace the 4IR in all its aspects."
"From Cyber-Security Deception To Manipulation and Gratification Through
  Gamification",2019-03-21T10:48:16Z,"With the ever growing networking capabilities and services offered to users,
attack surfaces have been increasing exponentially, additionally, the intricacy
of network architectures has increased the complexity of cyber-defenses, to
this end, the use of deception has recently been trending both in academia and
industry. Deception enables to create proactive defense systems, luring
attackers in order to better defend the systems at hand. Current applications
of deception, only rely on static, or low interactive environments. In this
paper we present a platform that combines human-computer-interaction,
analytics, gamification and deception to lure malicious users into selected
traps while piquing their interests. Furthermore we analyse the interactive
deceptive aspects of the platform through the addition of a narrative, further
engaging malicious users into following a predefined path and deflecting
attacks from key network systems."
A Comparative Analysis of the Cyber Security Strategy of Bangladesh,2019-05-01T13:04:57Z,"Technology is an endless evolving expression in modern era, which increased
security concerns and pushed us to create cyber environment. A National Cyber
Security Strategy (NCSS) of a country reflects the state of that country's
cyber strength which represents the aim and vision of the cyber security of a
country. Formerly, researchers have worked on NCSS by comparing NCSS between
different nations for international collaboration and harmonization and some
researchers worked on policy framework for their respective governments.
However very insignificant attempts had been made to assess the strategic
strength of NCSS of Bangladesh by performing cross comparisons on NCSS of
different Nations. Therefore, the motive of this research is to evaluate the
robustness of the existing cyber security strategy of Bangladesh in comparison
with some of the most technologically advanced countries in Asian continent and
others like USA, Japan, Singapore, Malaysia and India in order to keep the NCSS
of Bangladesh up-to-date."
On the Cost of Cyber Security in Smart Business,2019-05-15T09:59:39Z,"In a world, as complex and constantly changing as ours cloud computing is a
driving force for shaping the IT landscape and changing the way we do business.
Current trends show a world of people, things and services all digitally
interconnected via the Internet of Things (IoT). This applies in particular to
an industrial environment where smart devices and intelligent services pave the
way for smart factories and smart businesses. This paper investigates in a use
case driven study the potential of making use of smart devices to enable
direct, automated and voice-controlled smart businesses. Furthermore, the paper
presents an initial investigation on methodologies for measuring costs of cyber
security controls for cloud services."
ACE -- An Anomaly Contribution Explainer for Cyber-Security Applications,2019-12-01T04:16:12Z,"In this paper, we introduce Anomaly Contribution Explainer or ACE, a tool to
explain security anomaly detection models in terms of the model features
through a regression framework, and its variant, ACE-KL, which highlights the
important anomaly contributors. ACE and ACE-KL provide insights in diagnosing
which attributes significantly contribute to an anomaly by building a
specialized linear model to locally approximate the anomaly score that a
black-box model generates. We conducted experiments with these anomaly
detection models to detect security anomalies on both synthetic data and real
data. In particular, we evaluate performance on three public data sets: CERT
insider threat, netflow logs, and Android malware. The experimental results are
encouraging: our methods consistently identify the correct contributing feature
in the synthetic data where ground truth is available; similarly, for real data
sets, our methods point a security analyst in the direction of the underlying
causes of an anomaly, including in one case leading to the discovery of
previously overlooked network scanning activity. We have made our source code
publicly available."
"Vulnerability Assessment of Load Frequency Control Considering Cyber
  Security",2020-03-12T08:34:38Z,"Security is one of the biggest concern in power system operation. Recently,
the emerging cyber security threats to operational functions of power systems
arouse high public attention, and cybersecurity vulnerability thus become an
emerging topic to evaluate compromised operational performance under cyber
attack. In this paper, vulnerability of cyber security of load frequency
control (LFC) system, which is the key component in energy manage system (EMS),
is assessed by exploiting the system response to attacks on LFC
variables/parameters. Two types of attacks: 1) injection attack and 2) scale
attack are considered for evaluation. Two evaluation criteria reflecting the
damage on system stability and power generation are used to quantify system
loss under cyber attacks. Through a sensitivity-based method and attack tree
models, the vulnerability of different LFC components is ranked. In addition, a
post-intrusion cyber attack detection scheme is proposed. Classification-based
schemes using typical classification algorithms are studied and compared to
identify different attack scenarios."
Bayesian Models Applied to Cyber Security Anomaly Detection Problems,2020-03-23T16:26:13Z,"Cyber security is an important concern for all individuals, organisations and
governments globally. Cyber attacks have become more sophisticated, frequent
and dangerous than ever, and traditional anomaly detection methods have been
proved to be less effective when dealing with these new classes of cyber
threats. In order to address this, both classical and Bayesian models offer a
valid and innovative alternative to the traditional signature-based methods,
motivating the increasing interest in statistical research that it has been
observed in recent years. In this review we provide a description of some
typical cyber security challenges, typical types of data and statistical
methods, paying special attention to Bayesian approaches for these problems."
"SOK: Building a Launchpad for Impactful Satellite Cyber-Security
  Research",2020-10-21T09:58:00Z,"As the space industry approaches a period of rapid change, securing both
emerging and legacy satellite missions will become vital. However, space
technology has been largely overlooked by the systems security community. This
systematization of knowledge paper seeks to understand why this is the case and
to offer a starting point for technical security researchers seeking impactful
contributions beyond the Earth's mesosphere.
  The paper begins with a cross-disciplinary synthesis of relevant threat
models from a diverse array of fields, ranging from legal and policy studies to
aerospace engineering. This is presented as a ""threat matrix toolbox"" which
security researchers may leverage to motivate technical research into given
attack vectors and defenses. We subsequently apply this model to an original
chronology of more than 100 significant satellite hacking incidents spanning
the previous 60 years. Together, these are used to assess the state-of-the-art
in satellite security across four sub-domains: satellite radio-link security,
space hardware security, ground station security, and operational/mission
security. In each area, we note significant findings and unresolved questions
lingering in other disciplines which the systems security community is aptly
poised to tackle. By consolidating this research, we present the case that
satellite systems security researchers can build on strong, but disparate,
academic foundations and rise to meet an urgent need for future space missions."
A reputation game on cyber-security and cyber-risk calibration,2020-11-30T06:20:46Z,"To analyze strategic interactions arising in the cyber-security context, we
develop a new reputation game model in which an attacker can pretend to be a
normal user and a defender may have to announce attack detection at a certain
point of time without knowing whether he has been attacked. We show the
existence and uniqueness of sequential equilibrium in Markov strategies, and
explicitly characterize the players' equilibrium strategies. Using our model,
we suggest empirical and theoretical ways of calibrating the attack
probability, which is an important element of cyber-risks."
"Research Communities in cyber security: A Comprehensive Literature
  Review",2021-04-22T14:53:01Z,"In order to provide a coherent overview of cyber security research, the
Scopus academic abstract and citation database was mined to create a citation
graph of 98,373 authors active in the field between 1949 and early 2020. The
Louvain community detection algorithm was applied to the graph in order to
identify existing research communities. The analysis discovered twelve
top-level communities: access control, authentication, biometrics, cryptography
(I & II), cyber-physical systems, information hiding, intrusion detection,
malwares, quantum cryptography, sensor networks, and usable security. These
top-level communities were in turn composed of a total of 80 sub-communities.
The analysis results are presented for each community in descriptive text,
sub-community graphs, and tables with, for example, the most-cited papers and
authors. A comparison between the detected communities and topical areas
defined by other related work, is also presented, demonstrating a greater
researcher emphasis on cryptography, quantum cryptography, information hiding
and biometrics, at the expense of laws and regulation, risk management and
governance, and security software lifecycle."
