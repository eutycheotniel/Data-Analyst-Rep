# Description
This project revolves around a challenge from the arXiv platform related to data analysis and visualization. The goal is to explore and extract information from arXiv articles using Python, particularly focusing on the field of cyber security.

# Files in Repository
1. ArxivChallenge.csv
This CSV file contains the data extracted and processed from the arXiv API. It includes information such as article titles, publication dates, and summaries, providing a structured dataset for further analysis and visualization.

2. arxiv_challenge.ipynb
The Jupyter Notebook (arxiv_challenge.ipynb) is the main script for the project. It walks through the process of querying the arXiv API, processing the data, and creating visualizations. The notebook serves as a comprehensive guide to understanding the steps taken in the project.

3. VisualizationArxiv.pbix
The Power BI file (VisualizationArxiv.pbix) is included for those who want to explore the data through interactive visualizations. It connects to the CSV file to create dynamic and insightful visual representations of the arXiv article data.

4. README.md
This document provides an overview of the project, details about each file in the repository, and instructions on how to use and understand the project. It acts as a guide for anyone interested in exploring or contributing to the project.

# Getting Started
To explore the project, follow these steps:

Open arxiv_challenge.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook to review the code and understand the data processing steps.

Examine the ArxivChallenge.csv file for a structured representation of the arXiv article data.

If you prefer interactive visualizations, open VisualizationArxiv.pbix in Power BI and connect it to the CSV file.

Feel free to adapt and extend this project based on your requirements or use it as a starting point for further analysis.

# Dependencies
The project relies on Python libraries such as requests, xmltodict, and pandas for data retrieval and processing. Ensure these are installed before running the Jupyter Notebook.
